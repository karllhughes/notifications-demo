# Laravel 5.3 Notifications Demo

Created by [Karl Hughes]() for the [Laravel Chicago meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/laravel-chicago/) on October 25, 2016.

## About this project
This repository contains several branches - one for each feature of the Laravel Notifications system that I wanted to demo. You can follow along using the [original presentation on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/109VHOOHBmyRD-7xb1vgfYrHgNCvi23i3ct91MFzrops/edit?usp=sharing) or just check out the diffs between branches.

### Branches
- `mail` - Demo of the [Laravel Mail feature](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/mail).
- `notifications` - Demo of the [Laravel Notifications feature](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/notifications).
- `mail-vs-notifications` - Demonstrating the differences between using the Mail and Notifications features.
- `notifications-via` - Showing how to use the `via()` method to select notification providers.
